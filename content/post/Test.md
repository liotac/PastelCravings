## Long Title About Content
### Sub Title Describing Things
Normal text.
*Italicized text*
**Bold text rawr!**
***Bold AND Italic text oh lala :D***
To actually show the symbol use the escape character "\" in front of symbol ie. \*runs away, hands in the air\*
Symbols do work prolly: &copy; copright, &amp; ampersand finally &amp;copy &ampersand

Paragraph formating time:
Single line break is new line (duh)

Double line break makes a new paragraph. Simple Stuff really.

#### Sub-sub-sub Heading (h4)
I'm a fancy man and I like to quote important people:

> "Patato or potata"

Pomme de Terre
*Poire de **Sol*** <- This does not work

---

Holy shit a line! :)
Note that you need a blank line before the 3 dashes

##### Sub-s...whatever you get it (h5)
* List of things
* Continued list of things
+ This also works for list
- And so does this

1. For an ordered list of things
2. Do this, it works
*  This probably works
+  And maybe this but like, don't do it
    1. And if you were wondering
    2. This is how you sub list
        * It's turtles all the way down baby!
        * ...I'm a turtle
    4. You motherfucker you skipped one didn't you
    11. ...okay whatever

- [ ] todo
- [x] done

###### The last level of things (h6)
Imagine if you will some blabla
