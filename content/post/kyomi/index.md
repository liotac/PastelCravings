When you step in the restaurant, it's like entering a whole new world (believe me, you can't tell from outside). The decor screams romantic and modern asian fusion. It's the perfect place to bring in your date or a family gathering. 

I ordered the **Salmon Tartare** (meal version comes with sweet potatoes so why not?! :D) AND THIS RIGHT HERE IS HEAVEN. It's sweet and light, the asian inspiration crispy crackers go very well with this tartare.  

The sushis were so good and in big portions too! By big I mean it's fulfilling and not tiny pieces like other sushi restaurants. We were on a double date with our two favourite vegans so yes they do offer a vegan menu! 

For dessert, we went for Creme Brulee and Fried Banana with Ice Cream. 
I was not a fan of how they overcooked the surface of our Creme Brulee. I tend to be a bit picky about this dessert since it's one of my favourite hahah. 

## Overall

Great food, super tartare and my advice is to rbign a few friends with you to try this extensive menu! ;) 

Special thank you to My Hanh, the restaurant's manager for this lovely evening!
