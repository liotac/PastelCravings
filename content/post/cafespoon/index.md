Whenever I'm at Guy Concordia or Peel and {{< spoiler I >}} (a petit poussin){{< /spoiler >}} find myself searching for a coffee shop, this one is the first to pop in my head. Very accessible by metro, it only took me 5 mins to walk to Crescent St and find this little jewel. I love the decor, immediately the combination of the green from the plants and the white modern look caught my eyes.

They have a cute little space window where you can work and look outside and it emanates the feel of a greenhouse.

A for the menu, they don't offer an exhaustive list of drinks but they have an amazing Soup Soup place just above the coffee shop (which is owned by the same franchise). In winter, I usually order a hot chocolate or chamomille tea and my boyfriend goes for an americano.
