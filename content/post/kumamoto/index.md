When I heard about this new ramen place in town, I couldn't be happier. Because **more ramen is always good.**

What's cool about this new restaurant is **the isolation booth** concept. You have these wood panels separating you and you neighbors. You have a little button for ordering food and an autorefill water system.Then you receive your bowl of ramen through a curtain covered window.

## Unique Ramen 

I ordered a **Black Tonkotsu Ramen** and it was so savoury and delicious! <3 
The broth tastes creamy and light at the same time. Iâ€™ve been to all the ramen places of Montreal and I have to admit, until now I find this particular ramen super original and authentic. 

My boyfriend ordered the extra pork option, not a good idea. The pork is too salty!

## Cons 

+ **Quite Expensive** For a ramen place this is the most {{% spoiler expensive %}}(ranging from **16-18$** per bowl){{% /spoiler %}} one I've been to.
+ **The marinated egg is NOT included in the ramen**.
This is also the first time it happens in a ramen restaurant. They always offer free marinated egg and you can add extra eggs $$. But Kumamoto charges you right at the beginning (1.99$ per egg). 
+ **Pork is WAY TOO SALTY.** Someone has to lower that sodium dose!! 

## Overall

I would come back for The Black Tonkotsu Ramen if they can change the saltiness of the pork! :)
