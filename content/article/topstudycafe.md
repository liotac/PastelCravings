For this special post, I’ve asked my co-bloggers to list me all their top coffee places to study and I’ve assembled the ones that was in common on our lists.

A favourite of mine because of the accessibility by metro, the coziness of the place and the instagrammy worth of everyshot and every angle ! :D

This cute little gem is in the middle of Little Burgundy, accessible by metro (it takes around 6 mins walk). Freshly served coffee and their pastries are to die for! 


|ADDRESS: 2471 Notre-Dame St W, Montreal, QC H3J 1N6| Métro Lionel-Groulx

- **[Cafe Larue & Fils](https://www.facebook.com/caffedellavia// “Cafe Larue&Fils”)**
 A favourite of **Kim S** : *“People come with a laptop or a book. In the summer, Villeray is very lively because it’s a neighbourhood packed with young families and you can see kids running around or biking outside.“*


Alright, now that you finished procrastinating on that study session, get your ass back there AND STUDY :D 

Happy finals y’all!
