# Monopole café et buvette 

**Monopole is a coffee shop, restaurant and bar in the Cité du Multimédia**, a neighbourhood consisting mostly of tech companies. It has been open since May 12th.

It has a nice selection of pastries and serves coffee from 49th Parallel and Bows and Arrows. It has quickly become my go-to coffee shop for commuting to work between Old Montreal and Griffintown. Lunch and dinner menus are also available with good quality food for reasonable prices. 

**Independent coffee shops are very rare in the area, so Monopole is a great addition to the neighbourhood.** For professionals in the area, it’s also a good stop after work to have a glass of wine.

Address: 
782 Wellington
