## 5 Reasons why Crew slays

### 1. The Classiest Spot in Town 

Yes, you read it right. The classiest. Crew Collective Café is one of the most eye-candy coffee shop in our city, a main tourist attraction too. The building was once a bank and now they use the beautiful building design to turn it into a coffee shop and now also a lounge club (La Voute).

### 2. The Neighborhood and Accessibility 

Situated in the heart of the most elegant neighborhood in town, close to Metro Square Victoria (2 mins walk) and in front of te World Trade Center Montreal. 

### 3. Ordering Online 

Technology baby! Each table at Crew Café is numbered, so you order online and they bring yo uthe drinks! *N'est-ce pas merveilleux?* 

### 4. Study Booth 

These study booth are a gem for exams session! As you can see in the picture above, it's pretty dark in the central area of the coffee shop. Only in these study booth that you can find bright lighting that are necessary to do assignments and writing in general. I'm lucky to say that everytime I went there, I almost always got a study booth. They are very popular and are always full.
