            <p> Pastel Cravings has started when I have the idea of keeping track of all the restaurants and coffee shops I've been to. I started posting pictures on Instagram and coffee crawling has become one of my main hobby. The name behind the blog combines my love for anything pastel, light color and my absolute <i>coup de coeur</i> : food. Here you’ll find anything to restaurant and coffee shop reviews, as well as recipes.

        <b>Thank god, I'm not the only foodie in town!</b> I've asked some of my favourite girls to contribute and give you guys more variety in the food industry (because honestly if I'm the only one who blogs about food it won't be healthy LOL)

        <p> Hey there!</p>
        <p>
        My name is Laura - but some people call me Lauray. I’m a Dietetics/Nutrition student, a travel junkie, an art-lover and an aspiring food blogger (check out my health and lifestyle blog @colourmypalate)! Although I grew up and live in Montreal’s version of suburbia #westielyfe, like most people, I have fallen in love with the city and everything it has to offer. With every chance I get to visit, there’s always something new waiting for me. From its street art galore, to its countless independent cafes and stream of food festivals, Montreal has become my very own version of wonderland.
        </p>
        <p>I’m excited to share with you all my discoveries!</p>
        <p> Stay tuned! </p>
