      <description>For this special post, I’ve asked my co-bloggers to list me all their top coffee places to study and I’ve assembled the ones that was in common on our lists.
Legend: &amp;hearts; = the bloggers’ favourites
1. La Finca Coffee &amp;amp; Office |&amp;hearts;Laura
|&amp;hearts;Trang
|ADDRESS: 1067 Rue de Bleury, Montréal, QC H2Z 1N1| Métro Place D’Armes
A favourite of mine because of the accessibility by metro, the coziness of the place and the instagrammy worth of everyshot and every angle !</description>

      <description>Monopole is a coffee shop, restaurant and {bar in the Cité du Multimédia, a neighbourhood consisting mostly of tech companies. It has been open since May 12th.
It has a nice selection of pastries and serves coffee from 49th Parallel and Bows and Arrows. It has quickly become my go-to coffee shop for commuting to work between Old Montreal and Griffintown. Lunch and dinner menus are also available with good quality food for reasonable prices.</description>
