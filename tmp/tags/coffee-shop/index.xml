      <description>The Gaufré This place is by far, my favorite brunch spot for numerous reasons. First of all, the menu offers many interesting and creative choices, such as Scottish eggs, brioche bread, pulled ham, trout gravlax and mascarpone cheese cream. Even their oatmeal, made with coconut milk and mango jam, tastes spectacular. Every bite is heaven and the presentation is gorgeous. For those who are gluten intolerance, they offer a few gluten- free options.</description>

      <description>In the past years, I’ve had my fair share of following the trend of the #MTLCafeCrawl. After much exploring (and many cups of coffee in my system), I can definitely say that the Café Sfouf has become one of my all-time favorite cafes in Montreal.
When I first stumbled across this cute little spot in the Gay Village, I was drawn to its vintage exterior and the welcoming atmosphere that it exuded.</description>

      <description>Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m at Guy Concordia or Peel and I find myself searching for a coffee shop, this one is the first to pop in my head. Very accessible by metro, it only took me 5 mins to walk to Crescent St and find this little jewel. I love the decor, immediately the combination of the green from the plants and the white modern look caught my eyes.
They have a cute little space window where you can work and look outside and it emanates the feel of a greenhouse.</description>
