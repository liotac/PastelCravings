      <description>Once you enter the place, you will notice the coziness of the entrance. However, it’s only an illusion since they have more seats behind.
I ordered a Margherita Pizza (9$) and my boyfriend got the Italian Sausage (13$). The crust was perfect, not too dry, a little chewy and soft in the center. Tomato sauce was okay but what really amazes me was … THE CHEESE, miam ! &amp;lt;3
They also happen to have an open window counter which is ideal for summer.</description>
