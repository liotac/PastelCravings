      <description>When you step in the restaurant, it&amp;rsquo;s like entering a whole new world (believe me, you can&amp;rsquo;t tell from outside). The decor screams romantic and modern asian fusion. It&amp;rsquo;s the perfect place to bring in your date or a family gathering.
I ordered the Salmon Tartare (meal version comes with sweet potatoes so why not?! :D) AND THIS RIGHT HERE IS HEAVEN. It&amp;rsquo;s sweet and light, the asian inspiration crispy crackers go very well with this tartare.</description>

      <description>When I heard about this new ramen place in town, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier. Because more ramen is always good.
What&amp;rsquo;s cool about this new restaurant is the isolation booth concept. You have these wood panels separating you and you neighbors. You have a little button for ordering food and an autorefill water system.Then you receive your bowl of ramen through a curtain covered window.
Unique Ramen I ordered a Black Tonkotsu Ramen and it was so savoury and delicious!</description>

      <description>The Gaufré This place is by far, my favorite brunch spot for numerous reasons. First of all, the menu offers many interesting and creative choices, such as Scottish eggs, brioche bread, pulled ham, trout gravlax and mascarpone cheese cream. Even their oatmeal, made with coconut milk and mango jam, tastes spectacular. Every bite is heaven and the presentation is gorgeous. For those who are gluten intolerance, they offer a few gluten- free options.</description>

      <description>As you enter The Mile End, one of the hippest areas in Montreal, you’ll come across a quaint little brunch spot called Le Café Melbourne. First, you’ll notice a sign reading &amp;ldquo;Our French is not good, but our coffee is”, flash a grin, enter the café, and be greeted with the warm smiles of the Australian owner and his staff. Take a seat, and get ready for some Insta-worthy moments.</description>

      <description>In the past years, I’ve had my fair share of following the trend of the #MTLCafeCrawl. After much exploring (and many cups of coffee in my system), I can definitely say that the Café Sfouf has become one of my all-time favorite cafes in Montreal.
When I first stumbled across this cute little spot in the Gay Village, I was drawn to its vintage exterior and the welcoming atmosphere that it exuded.</description>

      <description>Monopole is a coffee shop, restaurant and {bar in the Cité du Multimédia, a neighbourhood consisting mostly of tech companies. It has been open since May 12th.
It has a nice selection of pastries and serves coffee from 49th Parallel and Bows and Arrows. It has quickly become my go-to coffee shop for commuting to work between Old Montreal and Griffintown. Lunch and dinner menus are also available with good quality food for reasonable prices.</description>

      <description>Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m at Guy Concordia or Peel and I find myself searching for a coffee shop, this one is the first to pop in my head. Very accessible by metro, it only took me 5 mins to walk to Crescent St and find this little jewel. I love the decor, immediately the combination of the green from the plants and the white modern look caught my eyes.
They have a cute little space window where you can work and look outside and it emanates the feel of a greenhouse.</description>

      <description>1. The Classiest Spot in Town Yes, you read it right. The classiest. Crew Collective Café is one of the most eye-candy coffee shop in our city, a main tourist attraction too. The building was once a bank and now they use the beautiful building design to turn it into a coffee shop and now also a lounge club (La Voute).
2. The Neighborhood and Accessibility Situated in the heart of the most elegant neighborhood in town, close to Metro Square Victoria (2 mins walk) and in front of te World Trade Center Montreal.</description>

      <description>Kampai Garden was one the most popular place even before it opened its doors last summer. Why? Because everything in the restaurant screams Instagram! From neon lights in the wall, to the french sentence, to the plants giving that green vibe everywhere.
 Kampai menu is very unique . I went there for supper the first time, got me some beef sashimi, sweet potato fries and fried chicken. For my second time they offered Poke!</description>

      <title>Pizzeria No.900</title>

      <description>Once you enter the place, you will notice the coziness of the entrance. However, it’s only an illusion since they have more seats behind.
I ordered a Margherita Pizza (9$) and my boyfriend got the Italian Sausage (13$). The crust was perfect, not too dry, a little chewy and soft in the center. Tomato sauce was okay but what really amazes me was … THE CHEESE, miam ! &amp;lt;3
They also happen to have an open window counter which is ideal for summer.</description>
